@novalis and I were stuck on a plane without internet, wanting to play a game of Go. It turned out that GoPanda2 (my usual client) won't even open without an internet connection, so we had to write this minimal board before we could play.  
&nbsp;  
Then we played a game, then we added the (again, minimalistic)  scoring function. Like y'do.

This really was an in-flight quick rough thing, so it's not exactly fully featured. You have to remove stones from the board yourself (by shift-clicking them), and must remove all dead stones at the end of the game before scoring.
